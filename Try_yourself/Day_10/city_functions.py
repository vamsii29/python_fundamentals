# Question_1: City, Country: Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name
# and a country name. The function should return a single string of the form
# City, Country, such as Santiago, Chile. Store the function in a module called
# city_functions.py.
# Create a file called test_cities.py that tests the function you just wrote
# (remember that you need to import unittest and the function you want to test).
# Write a method called test_city_country() to verify that calling your function
# with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' results in the correct string. Run
# test_cities.py, and make sure test_city_country() passes.


def city_country(city, country, population=''):
    # city = input('Enter a City: ')
    # country = input('Enter in which country is the city in: ')
    if population:
        final = city.title() + ', ' + country.title() + ', population - ' + population
    else:
        final = city.title() + ', ' + country.title()

    return final


# answer = city_country('bern','switzerland', '5M')
# print(answer)
